# Bounding Box Output Folder

#### When src/final_release.py is run, output files will show up in this folder. These will be chest X-Ray images overlaid with bounding boxes, generated by Mask R-CNN.

Because Mask R-CNN cannot differentiate between which diseases it is detecting, the images should be used in conjunction with the classification outputs displayed to the console from the final_release.py execution. In this way, inference and more informed diagnoses can be performed.
