## Scrum Documents

This folder contains the artifacts of the Scrum process that cannot be found in the Issues / Milestones / Labels sections of GitLab. These include the final burndown charts from each semester, and the Sprint plans, as they contain pictures of the issue board at different points in time that has since been changed.
